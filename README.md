# MCF-paper
Rcode: 
  Codes for the paper: Dai, X., Lin, N., Li, D., Wang, T.(2015) A non-randomized procedure for discrete multiple testing based on individual randomized test.

  BT.R: simulations for Binomial test (Note that: in Simulation code, we didn't use the wrapped-up funciton to implement the MCF-based method to avoid sampling randomized p-values multiple times for different alpha's)

  FET.R: simulations for Fisher's Exact test

  MT.R: a function to implement the MCF-based method

Supply:
  Supplementary material to: A non-randomized procedure for discrete multiple testing based on individual randomized test.
